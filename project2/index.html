<h1 id="project-iteration-2">Project Iteration 2</h1>
<p>For the second iteration, I would have prefered to work on something
else like better haptic integration. However when combining the
planetary simulation with the haptic preset, issues with performance
occured and as such I was plagued with trying to reprogram the tools for
the past two weeks.</p>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<p>When the Unity physics engine has too many celestial objects that it
needs to keep track of, it can do one of two things, the celestial
bodie’s orbit either becomes completely chaotic and or they just stop
moving. My challenge was to optimize the code so as to no longer have
such an issue.</p>

<p>The way each planet’s gravitational attraction is calculated is by
first determining their initial velocities to “stay in orbit around the
sun” and continue to update the planets positions using their
RigidBody2D components. Technically, the next challenge faced here is
placing the planets so that their orbits are maintained, like a moon
rotating around their planet and not the sun. This can be done in a few
ways. One way would be to use the Line Render to render the next few
thousand steps of the planet to see how it orbits it and then tune it’s
position, mass and initial velocity to allow for orbit.</p>
<p>It might not seem big, but a lot of research went into understanding
how the physics engine and task scheduling of unity works. With the
Haply computations happening in parralel using tasks, the issue with
performance would not lie there but rather in the rest of the events. We
calculate simple engines, a ship, a slignshot, and a solar system all in
series. Meaning that there is little space for the computations of the
planets positions.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/timming.png" /></p>
<p>As such the orbit calculations on their separate channel might be the
most beneficial in this situations.</p>
<p>What could be more interesting (as a thought) is placing each planet
in their own task so that they perform their computations in
parallel.</p>
<h2 id="future-steps">Future Steps</h2>
<p>As it is, the solar system simulation needs to be parallelized to
show even more noticeable performance, same can go for all the other
methods used in the project.</p>
<p>In terms of haptics, the relative change in the end effector decides
the propulsion of the ships engines, what would be beneficial is to
first have a callibration face at the beginning to give the user time to
center the end effector and then have the end effector change be
referenced to the calibrated zero and fire the engines with regard to
it.</p>

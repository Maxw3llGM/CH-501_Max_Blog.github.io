<p>Word 1: Flow</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>When using the haply with this sketch, it should feel as though you
are in water.</li>
</ul>
<p>Word 2: Nodes</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>You should be able to sense the push and pull from the nodes (source
and sink) within the environment.</li>

<p>Word 3: Particles</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>When navigating the water, you should feel particles of objects hit
and nudge the haply.</li>
</ul>
<p>An axiom, as per its definition, is a point from which we may start
to reason.</p>
<p>As such, these were the inital 3 “axioms” I used for my sketch.
However, the developping process is never perfect and I ran into far too
many problem trying to implement the second axiom “Nodes” that I had two
days left before the deadline and still have not completed the movements
for “Flow” and “Particles”.</p>

<p>Thanks to Brian Eno’s <a
href="http://stoney.sb.org/eno/oblique.html">Oblique Strategies</a>
helping me break out of my designers block, I decided to drop the Nodes
idea in the effort to find a new word. I did however learn alot about
how to calculate forces for the Haply. As such I started from scratch
and within one night I create a new set of words.</p>
<h2 id="words-phase-two">“Words” Phase Two</h2>
<h3 id="testing-phase">Testing Phase</h3>
<p>This time in order to have any road blocks in the development phase,
I tested a few ideas before I decided on my words.</p>
<p>I like the idea of particles moving across the simulation moving the
Haply’s end effector. As such I tested how easy it is to move static
objects.</p>
<p>Add Video</p>
<p>Once achieved, I moved on to testing my next idea. I knew I wanted to
use forces, by realizing that gravitational forces seem to be a bit too
tricky for the moment, I decided to test with the concept of noise, or
rather friction in this case. At first, I tried to use the hAPI’s fBody
class “setfriction” function but soon realized it did not have the same
effect I had hope for as it did not yield any noticeable change in how
the haply interacted with the fBody. So, pulling from the knowledge I
cultivated from trying to implement the nodes, I chose to input noise
into the force values of the haply. This was achieved by adding a scaled
randome value in the resulting end effector force variable:</p>
<p><code>f_ee.add(4000*random(0.0,1.0),4000*random(0.0,1.0));</code></p>
<p>Add video here:</p>
<p>Once I new this was possible I found my idea for the second word.</p>
<h3 id="selection">Selection</h3>
<p>Word 1: Particles</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Using FCircle objects, I wanted to slightly move and nudge the end
effector of the haply to simulate the idea of bumping into
something.</li>
</ul>
<p>Word 2: Noise</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Now that I know how to using noise into the force of the haply,
otherwise called friction. I can guide the user through the environment
with friction, where they can pass the haply over an area and feel a
change in the simulations surface to be rougher.</li>
</ul>
<p>Word 3: Space</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Using a wall with multiple holes and is thus a wall made up of
equally spaced smaller walls. The use can percieve the gape in between
the walls, until they might find one that can be moved out of the way
and they can pass the wall.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implementation-phase-3">“Implementation” Phase 3</h2>
<p>Now is time to realize these idea. I first started with the second
word, “Noise”.</p>
<p>Througout my designe process I always had in mind that the sketch
must have an overarching motion to it, like left to write. As such, I
though that I can use the noise to convey that idea to the use. I
therefore decided to add a gradient to the noise based on it’s
horizontal position in space. One side will naturally induce more noise
into the end effector than the other.</p>
<p>It’s akin to concept of particles wanting to always go their lowers
energy state, from High to Low potential energy.</p>
<p><embed src="./photos/ngrad.pdf" /></p>
<p>Initially I decided to create a (as close too) continuous noise
gradient in the environemnt.</p>
<p>This was achieved by taking the position of the end effector in the
virtual space (not measured position, there is a different to be made
here),</p>
<p><code>ee_vposx = s.getAvatarPositionX();</code> ,</p>
<p>and then slowy increase the end effector forces noise level as it’s
going in a certain direction. This was rather simple to do, however it
did not feel as though it was enough, there was not enough texture to
it’s feeling. So, I discretized it to create strips of friction within
the environment.</p>
<p><embed src="./photos/fLines.pdf" /></p>
<p>Each strip will also gradually increase and decrease to and from the
max friction value based on ds, the max distance away from the mid point
of the strip. I was able to achieve this by wraping the position of the
end effector with a modulo function based on the amount of strips I want
dividing up the max width of the world.</p>
<p><embed src="./photos/part.pdf" /></p>
<p>Once that was completed, I proceeded to implement the particles.
Since I have a horizontal direction, I thought of using the particles as
a way to induce direction on the vertical axis. I thus decided to put
them in the middle of the world going from top to bottom as a way create
the idea of a stream of particles that the user is passing through.</p>
<p>Add Video.</p>
<p>This was achieved by positioning 3 FCircle objects in the center of
the sketch and having them move from top to bottom. Everytime they wrape
around, the speed at which they are moving changes.</p>
<p>Finally, when implementing the idea of the walls I decided to change
my approache and simple create one wall with two opening at the bottom
and top of the wall so that the user needs to find them by touch. This
choice was for simplicity reasons as there was too much feedback from
the end effector due to the noise strips and the particles.</p>

<h2 id="words-phase-one">“Words” Phase One</h2>
<p>Word 1: Flow</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>When using the Haply with this sketch, it should feel as though you
are in water.</li>
</ul>
<p>Word 2: Nodes</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>You should be able to sense the push and pull from the nodes (source
and sink) within the environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Word 3: Particles</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>When navigating the water, you should feel particles of objects hit
and nudge the haply.</li>
</ul>
<p>An axiom, as per its definition, is a point from which we may start
to reason.</p>
<p>As such, these were the initial 3 “axioms” I used for my sketch.
However, the developing process is never perfect and I ran into far too
many problems trying to implement the second axiom “Nodes” that I had
two days left before the deadline and still have not completed the
movements for “Flow” and “Particles”.</p>

<p>Thanks to Brian Eno’s <a
href="http://stoney.sb.org/eno/oblique.html">Oblique Strategies</a>
helping me break out of my designers block, I decided to drop the Nodes
idea in the effort to find a new word. I did however learn a lot about
how to calculate forces for the Haply. As such I started from scratch
and within one night, I create a new set of words.</p>
<h2 id="words-phase-two">“Words” Phase Two</h2>
<h3 id="testing-phase">Testing Phase</h3>
<p>This time to not have any roadblocks in the development phase, I
tested a few ideas before I decided on my words.</p>
<p>I like the idea of particles moving across the simulation moving the
Haply’s end effector. As such I tested how easy it is to move static
objects.</p>
<p>Add Video</p>
<p>Once achieved, I moved on to testing my next idea. I knew I wanted to
use forces, by realizing that gravitational forces seem to be a bit too
tricky for the moment, I decided to test with the concept of noise, or
rather friction in this case. At first, I tried to use the hAPI’s fBody
class “setfriction” function but soon realized it did not have the same
effect I had hope for as it did not yield any noticeable change in how
the haply interacted with the fBody. So, pulling from the knowledge I
cultivated from trying to implement the nodes, I chose to input noise
into the force values of the haply. This was achieved by adding a scaled
random value in the resulting end effector force variable:</p>
<p><code>f_ee.add(4000*random(0.0,1.0),4000*random(0.0,1.0));</code></p>
<p>Add video here:</p>
<p>Once I knew this was possible I found my idea for the second
word.</p>
<h3 id="selection">Selection</h3>
<p>Word 1: Particles</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Using FCircle objects, I wanted to slightly move and nudge the end
effector of the haply to simulate the idea of bumping into
something.</li>
</ul>
<p>Word 2: Noise</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Now that I know how to add noise into the force of the haply,
otherwise called friction. I can guide the user through the environment
with friction, where they can pass the haply over an area and feel a
change in the simulations surface to be rougher.</li>
</ul>
<p>Word 3: Space</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Using a wall with multiple holes and is thus a wall made up of
equally spaced smaller walls. The use can perceive the gape in between
the walls, until they might find one that can be moved out of the way
and they can pass the wall.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implementation-phase-3">“Implementation” Phase 3</h2>
<p>Now is time to realize these idea. I first started with the second
word, “Noise”.</p>
<p>Throughout my design process I always had in mind that the sketch
must have an overarching motion to it, like left to write. As such, I
thought that I can use the noise to convey that idea to the use. I
therefore decided to add a gradient to the noise based on its horizontal
position in space. One side will naturally induce more noise into the
end effector than the other.</p>
<p>It’s akin to concept of particles wanting to always go their lowers
energy state, from High to Low potential energy.</p>
<p><embed src="./photos/ngrad.pdf" /></p>
<p>Initially I decided to create a (as close too) continuous noise
gradient in the environment.</p>
<p>This was achieved by taking the position of the end effector in the
virtual space (not measured position, there is a different to be made
here),</p>
<p><code>ee_vposx = s.getAvatarPositionX();</code> ,</p>
<p>and then slowly increase the end effector forces noise level as it’s
going in a certain direction. This was rather simple to do, however it
did not feel as though it was enough, there was not enough texture to
its feeling. So, I discretized it to create strips of friction within
the environment.</p>
<p><embed src="./photos/fLines.pdf" /></p>
<p>Each strip will also gradually increase and decrease to and from the
max friction value based on ds, the max distance away from the midpoint
of the strip. I was able to achieve this by wrapping the position of the
end effector with a modulo function based on the number of strips I want
dividing up the max width of the world.</p>
<p><embed src="./photos/part.pdf" /></p>
<p>Once that was completed, I proceeded to implement the particles.
Since I have a horizontal direction, I thought of using the particles as
a way to induce direction on the vertical axis. I thus decided to put
them in the middle of the world going from top to bottom as a way create
the idea of a stream of particles that the user is passing through.</p>
<p>Add Video.</p>
<p>This was achieved by positioning 3 FCircle objects in the center of
the sketch and having them move from top to bottom. Every time they wrap
around, the speed at which they are moving changes.</p>
<p>Finally, when implementing the idea of the walls I decided to change
my approach and simple create one wall with two opening at the bottom
and top of the wall so that the user needs to find them by touch. This
choice was for simplicity reasons as there was too much feedback from
the end effector due to the noise strips and the particles.</p>
<h2 id="revision-phase-finale">Revision Phase Finale</h2>
<p>Now that all 3 words have been implemented, let review them:</p>
<p>Word 1: Particles</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Using FCircle objects, I wanted to slightly move and nudge the end
effector of the haply to simulate the idea of bumping into something.
Sending them in a straight line from bottom to top in the middle of the
sketch has created an area that the user can cross, like a river.</li>
</ul>
<p>Word 2: Textured gradient</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Using a set of friction zones evenly distributed in the form of
vertical strips. I can gently decrease from left to right the strength
of the friction to give a sense of direction in which the end effector
should go.</li>
</ul>
<p>Word 3: Space</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Once the user reaches the right side of the sketch, (low friction
level) and past the stream of particles, the user must find by touch the
openings from which they can pass</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2>
<p>When working on this lab. I ran into a big roadblock at the beginning
when trying to implement a simple kind of gravity. That being said, I
did learn a lot on how the API computes all of the forces and objects.
As such when moving past this, I was able to implement my friction model
quickly and efficiently. I think that the most expressive part is the
textured gradient movement amongst the three as it is the most
continuous movement in the sketch. I feel as though I wished it could
have been more of an experience than the playground it currently feels
like.</p>
<p>When showing this to a few people I got some input on what they
though was happening.</p>
<p>The first tester gave as words: scratching, bouncing and contour.
They all describe appropriately the three movements in my sketch.</p>
<p>Whilst the second gave as responses: rough, gears and springy. For
roughness, it meant that they were able to perceive the strips of
texture, however the gradient was hard to notice, meaning that I should
implement a different kind of gradient next time. The gears were close
to particles as they both would move the end effector in similar manners
and as for springy, I think that it is a better word to describe the
wall that was implemented instead of the word space.</p>

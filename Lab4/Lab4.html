actuation using PID</h1>
<h2 id="part-1-p-component">Part 1: P Component</h2>
<p>When simply increasing the P variable, I felt a pull no matter where
to the target position. When comparing the force to the arrow displayed
on the sketch, the arrow seemed to lag behind the force feedbacks
response. Also, when crossing an axis sign (-x to +x and vice versa), I
can feel that the force exerted on the end effector is a cartesian force
(which is the case as scene in the code). I would think that for
situations like this where there is a target position, the force felt on
the end effector should not be a pull to the target’s axial zero points
and rather a force that pulls the end effector to it radially.</p>

<p>When setting the P parameter to a very low value (0.01), force on the
end effector is only felt at the very extreme bounds of the sketches
space. At too high of a level (around 1 and above) aliasing issues occur
resulting in oscillation.</p>

<p>When changing the targets position, the device will move to the
target at a speed proportionate to the P gain and if there is not enough
damping applied to the force from holding the end effector, then it will
start to oscillate. Because the change in the targets position is so
quick, an issue seems to arise where the device will quickly move to the
target, overshoot due to the amount of force it exerted then not stop at
a certain distance. The distance from the target to which it stops may
be due to the amount of force being exerted from the motors being equal
to or lower than the friction force of the cursor on its surface and so
at higher P levels that will not be an issue.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-d-component">Part 2: D Component</h2>
<p>When adding the D component in, it is hard to notice the change, but
I do feel as if my travel with the cursor is dampened or to be more
specific the force I apply to the cursor is being dampened and this is
due to the nature of the Derivative’s equation. It minimizes the rate of
change of the error. One other way to look at this from a physics
standpoint is that it is minimizing the cursors velocity and that
technically the equation is equivalent to the equation for momentum.</p>

<p>The smoothing is also important and by using the exponential
smoothing equation, (in this case) higher amounts of smoothing results
in the derivative value taking longer to change. Hence why at lower
smoothing levels, problem arises where the pointer starts to glitch out
and is felt through the pointer as almost noise. This can then cause
oscillations if not damped appropriately.</p>

<h2 id="part-3-i-component">Part 3: I Component</h2>
<p>The integral is exactly what the name states it takes the errors
slope and finds the amount under its slope. Essentially acting as a
running sum and is meant to help the desired device not stay within a
steady state. In the case of the Haply, steady states arise within high
friction/resistance zones. Through my testing, these zones are usually
along the vertical axis of the haply as the haply’s vertical force does
not seem to be as strong as it’s horizontal. As such when fully extended
down the vertical axis or the cursor hits a high friction zone, it is
put into a “steady state zone” where the force of the motors equals the
force of resistance on the cursor.</p>

<p>When activating the I component, I encountered an issue where there is
always one area that seems to not exert force on the actuator. When
diving into the code and printing out values I discovered that the
cummerror values seem to be bugged and is what had been causing said
issue in the simulation. At first, I thought it was integral windup, but
because the calculation was being performed at start-up, the cursor and
the targets position might not of been fully rendered and the cumerror
value essentially blows and caused a buffer overflow issue. But out of
Processing logic, that did not throw any errors in the terminal. So, to
fix it I just had the value (cumerror) start being computed after nine
to ten iterations of the loop.</p>
<p>Now, when I was finally able to get it working, I needed to implement
some integral windup countermeasures. as the value is already
constrained between -4 and 4, the optimisation lies within these bounds.
So, whenever the cursor moved past the targets axis, I had the cummerror
value reset to 0, which drastically helped with the
overshoot.</p>
<p>With that, I was able to create a semi stable system.</p>

<h2 id="part-4-path-tracking">Part 4: Path Tracking</h2>
<p>For this question, I ended up implementing a circular path for the
target.</p>
<p><code>float inc = TWO_PI/12.0;</code></p>
<p><code>float angle = 0;</code></p>
<p><code>float r = 0.5;</code></p>
<p><code>public void RandomPosition(int theValue) {       xr = r*cos(angle);       yr = r*sin(angle);       angle += inc; }</code></p>
<p>While experimenting with the path tracking, I found that holding the
handle stabilizes the motion of the cursor moving to the target and
reduces potential oscillations. When not holding the handle the PID
parameters needed to be lower so as to not overshoot, or glitch out. </p>
<p><video width="100%" src="videos/NoHand.mp4" controls=""><a
    href="videos/NoHand.mp4">Video</a></video></p>
<p>But whilst holding the handle, I can increase the PID values, creating a
stronger response. But too strong of PID values and it can still loose stability.</p>

<h2 id="part-5-delays">Part 5: Delays</h2>
<p>Changing the sampling rate will change the rate at which the system
responds to a change in the handle or targets position. Based on the
Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, if the sampling frequency is too low
then aliasing will occur folding whatever frequency that is past half
the sampling rate over.</p>
<p>At a faster sampling rate, the overshooting is much smaller than at
slower sampling rates and what was previously properly tuned PID
constants no longer works.</p>
<p>When I have the loop time randomly change every x number of
iterations, the movement becomes completely irregular making it
impossible to tune. The only way to manage a device that has a varying
sample rate and or aliasing that would create the same effect is to
either have the PID constants be very low and or use a hand guided
system to help mitigate the issues.</p>

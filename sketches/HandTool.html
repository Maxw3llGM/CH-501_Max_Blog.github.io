    My second sketch, inspired by the Touche from espressivee is a
    surface that that you lie flat your hand on and push, tilt and
    shake.

    The goal was to create a surface that can interact with the entire
    hand on the level of 10 mm. <img src="../photos/handtool.jpg" /> I built
    this device using packaging foam in the center, with 4 spring embeded on
    each corner for added support, sandwiched between two pieces of ply wood
    and held down using two springs held in place with notches in the wood.

    In the video I demonstrate how it would be used. Notably so, It would be interesting to
    give feedback to the user about what is happening in software by
    mechanically tilting the surface a force feedback and potentially have
    it be a vibrotactile surface to allow for more nuanced feedback. That is
    why I use my other hand to push up on the wood.

## Shaker

Inspired from some junk laying around at my Lab, this is a simple slinky like spring attached at both ends to a neon light frame looking object with a wire coilled around one end of the spring assymetrically. 

The rigid frame acts almost like a skeleton to the spring. It gives the user more control over it's motion with one hand leaving your other hand to interact with it in a meaning full mannor. Thus by having a wire place assymetrically along the wire, pulling and pushing the wire leads to more chaotic behaviours, adding randomness which can be beneficial in terms of creative uses.

Technically, if this were to be develloped sensors seen in spring reverb pedals would be used to keep track of the springs displacent. The information would then be fed into some software as a modulation agent for audio, images and so forth. It would be a kind of hybrid spring reverb pedal.

<p>Inspired from some junk laying around at my Lab, this is a simple
slinky like spring attached at both ends to a neon light frame looking
object with a wire coilled around one end of the spring
assymetrically.</p>
<p>The rigid frame acts almost like a skeleton to the spring. It gives
the user more control over itâ€™s motion with one hand leaving your other
hand to interact with it in a meaning full mannor. Thus by having a wire
place assymetrically along the wire, pulling and pushing the wire leads
to more chaotic behaviours, adding randomness which can be beneficial in
terms of creative uses.</p>
<p>Technically, if this were to be develloped sensors seen in spring
reverb pedals would be used to keep track of the springs displacent. The
information would then be fed into some software as a modulation agent
for audio, images and so forth. It would be a kind of hybrid spring
reverb pedal.</p>
